Styling: Implements Tailwind CSS .


###Project Structure

- api/: This directory is used for making server requests and also stores a file named types which contains types for server-side data. This setup helps in managing data interactions centrally.

- app/: Contains server-side components. These are likely Next.js pages or components that involve server-side logic, such as dynamic data fetching at request time.

- components/: Houses client-side components. These are React components meant to be used on the client side, focusing on user interactions and UI rendering.

- context/: Includes configurations for useContext which is used for state management across the application. This setup allows for maintaining application state in a more manageable and scalable way.

- lib/: Contains models.ts, a file that might define data models or interfaces used throughout the application. Additionally, there is a helpers folder that includes utility functions which assist in various functionalities across the project.

- ui/: Stores reusable UI components. These components are designed to be reused in different parts of the application, ensuring consistency and efficiency in UI development.

##Main functional

- Authentication: Users can sign in to access and interact with the platform securely.
- Job Recommendations: The system analyzes user preferences and behavior to suggest relevant job vacancies.
- Favorites Feature: Users have the ability to like or bookmark their preferred job listings for easy access later.
